Hello,

I'm Marek (Paq88), a Master's student in Bioinformatics at Wroclaw University of Environmental and Life Sciences in Poland. My work primarily focuses on genome assembly and variant calling pipelines, utilizing Nanopore and Illumina reads. 
I have experience in building and testing variant calling pipelines using Nextflow. Additionally, I am good in programming languages such as Python, R, and Bash.
Recently, Im developing a special interest in Neural Networks and have constructed an NN Classifier based on fish microbiome data.
